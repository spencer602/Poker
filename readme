extra documentation for the 'code' list used in poker.py:
code is a list of integers used to compare poker hands. The left-most
(first) elements in the list are the most significant. The first item in
the list is the hand ranking (flush, trips, etc). The next integer in the 
list will be the next most significant ranking (for example, for a flush,
'code' could be [6,12,11,9,7,4]. 6 means flush. 12 would be queen, 11 would
be jack, 9 would be 9, etc) 

Using the code system this way allows for effective and efficient exhaustive 
comparison of hands
